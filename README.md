# Instacart-analysis-sql-queries
Instacart is an online grocery platform and I explored the dataset to derive insights that can optimize operations and enhance customer experience.
Market basket and customer segmentation analysis were the major analysis carried out.
The SQL queries written during analysis is published on github while the full report of the analysis can be found on [medium](https://aadesolaa.medium.com/instacart-analysis-e8c7326a25c6).
